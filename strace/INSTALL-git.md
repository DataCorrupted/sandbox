Build strace from git repository
================================
If you use the GIT version of strace there will be some files missing
that you need to build strace.  These files are generated by tools from
the GNU Autoconf and Automake packages.

Note: rather than running `autoreconf` directly, use the `./bootstrap` script
and follow the instructions given in given in [INSTALL](INSTALL) file for further installation.
